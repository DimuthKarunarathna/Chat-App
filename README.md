Welcome to our demo version of a chat app built using Flutter! This app is designed to showcase the basic functionality of a real-time chat application. With this app, users can create an account, sign in, and start chatting with other users in real-time. The app is built with Flutter, which is a powerful and flexible mobile app development framework. Flutter enables us to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces for both iOS and Android devices with a single codebase. This demo version is intended to give you a taste of what our chat app can do, and we hope that you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it!
